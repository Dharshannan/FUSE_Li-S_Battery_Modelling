* This folder will contain the files for the model class and solver function definiation.
* The file module.py (containing the Li-S model and Solver function) is called within the test_module.py file to run the solver.
* The finished results are saved into a npz file using the np.savez() command, which allows access of the variables without needing to re-run the model solver.
* The file test_saved_variables.py shows how to load the data and plot the variable values.
* NOTE: IMPORTANT TO ENSURE ALL THE FILES ARE SAVED IN THE SAME DIRECTORY/FOLDER !!!
